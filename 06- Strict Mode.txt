- it's a peace of code we can use over and over again in our code and can hold one or more complate lines of code .

**** function behave as a value so we can store it in a variable ****

// function declaration
	function name(param) {

	}

- function declaration can invoke before the initialization.


// function expression
const name =	function (param) {
		code.....
	}

- function expression can not invoke before the initialization.
