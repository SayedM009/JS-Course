--- Values in Js is Object or Primitive:

Object => let me  = {
	name : 'sayed'
}

- Primitive => let myName = 'sayed';
let age = 26;

- Primitives Datatype : 

1- Number, float.
2- String : Squence of characters.
3- Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false.
4- undefined: value taken by a varibale that is not yet defind.
5- Null: Also means 'empty value'.
6- Symbol: value that is unique and cannot be changed.
7- BigInt: larger integers that that number type can hold.

-- Js has dynamic typing: we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. instead, data types are determind automatically.

******IN JS that value has a type NOT variable.******

-- let :

- Best way to diclare an empty varibale.
- Can reassign the value in let.


-- const: 

- Cannot declare an empty varibale.
- Best way to write the fixed variable.
- Cannot reassign the value in const you have declared(that happen to primtive value not reffrences value like object or array).

--- var: it's legacey way to declare the variable (not recommanded).

- when you declare an variable with it (var) will create  a property in the global object (window) has the value of variable.
- Can reassign the value in var.


****** the default is using const to declare a new variable but you have to be sure the variable will not change in the future, else you can use let ******
