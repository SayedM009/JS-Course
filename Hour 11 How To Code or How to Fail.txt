--- The Problems : 

- i jupm at the problem without much thinking
- i implement the solution in an unstructured way
- i become streassed out when things don't work
- i am too proud to research solutions



--- The Solutions :  
- stay calm and slow down, don't just jump at a problem without a plan. 

-  take a very logical and rational approach ( programming is just logic, in the end...)

- use these 4-step framework to solve may problem. 

- Step 01: make sure you 100% understand the problem, Ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem.

- Step 02: Divide and conquer : break a big problem into smaller  sub-problems

- Step 03: Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to

- Step 04: For bigger problems, write pseduo-code before writing the actual code
